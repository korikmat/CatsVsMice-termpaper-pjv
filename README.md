This game is created in the style of the Tower Defense game genre. Only instead of towers, castle and enemy soldiers - cats, cheese and mice. What is required from the player: to mark the path on which the mice will walk, set up the cats, depending on the amount of money, add cats during the game if necessary. At the beginning of the game you will have a small balance of money for which you can buy cats, and for each neutralized mouse you will also get a small amount of money. In case at least one mouse still passes to the cheese, the game ends, you lose. You will also be able to buy different cats, which will differ in the damage they inflict - they will cost differently accordingly. 
At the very beginning of the game the user will have a window where he can choose the difficulty of the game (the damage caused and the number of mice) and also create a path for the mice. When the game passes, a window will open in which the user can start the game again.
